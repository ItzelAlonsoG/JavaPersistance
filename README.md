# Introduction

**Data persistence** is a means by which an application can retrieve information from a non-volatile storage system and make it persist. Data persistence is vital in business applications due to the necessary access to relational databases. Applications developed for this environment must manage persistence on their own or use third-party solutions to handle updates and recoveries of databases with persistence. JPA (Java â„¢ Persistence API) provides a mechanism to manage object relational mapping and persistence and works from the EJB 3.0 specifications.

**API** is an acronym that comes from the English language and refers to the expression Application Programming Interface (whose translation is Application Programming Interface). The concept refers to the processes, functions and methods provided by a certain programming library as an abstraction layer to be used by another computer program.

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** is an acronym for the ways in which you can operate on stored information. It is a mnemonic for the four functions of persistent storage. CRUD usually refers to operations carried out in a database or data warehouse, but it can also apply to higher-level functions of an application such as soft deletes where the information is not really deleted, but is marked as deleted at through a status.

**Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)** is the JavaSoft specification for a standard application programming interface (API) that enables Java programs to access database management systems. The JDBC API consists of a set of interfaces and classes written in the Java programming language. With these standard classes and interfaces, programmers can write applications that connect to databases, submit queries written in structured query language (SQL), and process the results. Since JDBC is a standard specification, a Java program that uses the JDBC API can connect to any database management system (DBMS), as long as there is a driver for that particular DBMS.
